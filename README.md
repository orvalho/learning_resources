# Learning resources I use & recommend

## JavaScript

- [x] [Learn Javascript](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gitbookio/javascript/details). This book teaches the basics of programming in JS. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in JS. Extremely simple. Very clear to the point.
- [x] [Learn JavaScript in One Week](https://coderbyte.com/course/learn-javascript-in-one-week). A great resource to learn the basics of JS and to practice solving some challenges.
